1. Can you explain the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and how they are applied in Java?

Answer: Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that organizes code into objects, which encapsulate data and behavior.
In Java, OOP principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit. Inheritance allows a class to inherit
properties and methods from another class. Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.

2.How do you handle exceptions in Java, and can you give an example of a checked and an unchecked exception?

Answer: In Java, exceptions are handled using try-catch blocks. Checked exceptions must be caught or declared in the method signature using "throws," while unchecked exceptions do not require this.

3.Explain the life cycle of a Spring Boot application.

Answer: The life cycle of a Spring Boot application involves initialization, execution, and destruction. During initialization, the application context is created, and components are scanned. The execution phase involves handling HTTP requests, processing business logic, and interacting with databases. Destruction occurs when the application is shut down, and resources are released.

4.What is dependency injection, and how is it implemented in Spring?

Answer: Dependency injection is a design pattern where the components of a system are provided with their dependencies instead of creating them internally. In Spring, dependency injection is achieved through inversion of control (IoC) and is implemented using either constructor injection or setter injection.

5.How do you optimize the performance of a Spring Boot application?

Answer: Performance optimization in Spring Boot involves various aspects, such as database optimization, caching, using connection pools, minimizing unnecessary resource loading, and employing efficient algorithms. Additionally, profiling tools can be used to identify bottlenecks.

6.Explain the difference between REST and SOAP.

Answer: REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are web service architectures. REST is lightweight, stateless, and uses standard HTTP methods for communication. SOAP, on the other hand, is a protocol that relies on XML and can use various transport protocols. REST is generally preferred for simplicity and scalability.

7.How would you approach designing a scalable and maintainable web application using Spring Boot?

Answer: Designing a scalable and maintainable web application involves proper architectural decisions. Utilize modularization, microservices architecture, and follow best practices for coding standards. Use caching mechanisms, optimize database queries, and implement effective error handling.

8.Explain the difference between the equals() method and the == operator in Java.

Answer: The equals() method is used to compare the content of objects for equality, while the == operator checks whether two references point to the same object in memory.

9.How would you handle database transactions in a Spring Boot application?

Answer: Spring provides declarative transaction management using annotations like @Transactional. This ensures that a series of operations either complete successfully or leave the system in a consistent state by rolling back the changes in case of failure.

10.Discuss the role of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in Spring.

Answer: MVC is a design pattern used in Spring to separate concerns within a web application. The Model represents the data, the View is responsible for the presentation, and the Controller handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.

11.What is the purpose of the @Autowired annotation in Spring, and how does it work?

Answer: The @Autowired annotation in Spring is used for automatic dependency injection. It allows Spring to automatically inject dependencies into a bean by searching for a matching type in the application context.

12.Explain the difference between stateful and stateless authentication.

Answer: Stateful authentication involves storing user session information on the server, while stateless authentication does not store session information. Stateless authentication is often preferred for scalability and can be implemented using tokens, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

13.Explain the difference between stateful and stateless authentication.

Answer: Stateful authentication involves storing user session information on the server, while stateless authentication does not store session information. Stateless authentication is often preferred for scalability and can be implemented using tokens, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

14.How does Java handle memory management, and what is the purpose of the garbage collector?

Answer: Java uses automatic memory management, and the garbage collector is responsible for reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced. It helps prevent memory leaks and ensures efficient memory usage.

15.Describe the SOLID principles and how they are applied in software development.

Answer: SOLID is an acronym representing five design principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion). These principles guide the design of maintainable and scalable software by promoting modularization and flexibility.

16.What is the purpose of the @RequestMapping annotation in Spring MVC?

Answer: The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map a web request to a specific method or controller in a Spring MVC application. It helps define the URL patterns for handling different types of HTTP requests.

17.How would you secure a Spring Boot application, and what security mechanisms are available?

Answer: Spring Security is a powerful authentication and access control framework for securing Spring applications. It provides features like authentication, authorization, and protection against common security threats. Consider using features like user authentication, role-based access control, and HTTPS for secure communication.

18.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation in Java?

Answer: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. Encapsulation, on the other hand, involves bundling the data and the methods that operate on the data within a single unit, i.e., a class.

19.Explain the concept of polymorphism and provide examples in Java.

Answer: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. Examples include method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism) in Java.

20.How does inheritance promote code reusability in Java?

Answer: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse. Subclasses can reuse the code of their parent class and override or extend functionalities as needed.

21.What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?

Answer: An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, while an interface can only have abstract methods (prior to Java 8). Interfaces support multiple inheritance, while a class can extend only one abstract class.

22.Can you explain the "super" keyword in Java and how it is used?

Answer: The "super" keyword in Java is used to refer to the immediate parent class's object or invoke its methods. It is often used to differentiate between the members of the subclass and the superclass with the same name.

23.How does the "final" keyword impact class, method, and variable declarations in Java?

Answer: The "final" keyword can be applied to a class to make it uninheritable, to a method to prevent overriding, and to a variable to make it a constant (cannot be reassigned).

24.What is Spring Spring Boot Actuator

Answer: Spring Boot Actuator is a set of production-ready features that can be easily added to a Spring Boot application. These features help you monitor and manage your application when it's running in production. Actuator provides endpoints that expose information about your application, such as health, metrics, environment properties, and more.

Here are some key features of Spring Boot Actuator:

Health Endpoint: Provides information about the health of your application, indicating whether it's running properly.

Metrics Endpoint: Exposes various metrics about your application, such as memory usage, garbage collection statistics, and custom metrics you may define.

Info Endpoint: Allows you to expose arbitrary information about your application.

Environment Endpoint: Shows information about the environment properties of your application.

Shutdown Endpoint: Provides the ability to shut down the application gracefully.

Loggers Endpoint: Enables you to view and configure logging levels at runtime.

Thread Dump Endpoint: Captures and exposes a thread dump of the application.

Heap Dump Endpoint: Generates and exposes a heap dump of the application.
